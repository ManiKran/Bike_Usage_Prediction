# Bike_Usage_Prediction
The Chicago Divvy Bike-sharing program, managed by the Chicago Department of
Transportation (CDOT), is a popular transportation option for both residents and visitors.
Understanding the factors that drive bike usage is crucial for stakeholders who are
tasked with making decisions about station placement, bike fleet management, and
service optimization. By analyzing historical data from 2022 to 2023, this project aims to
develop a predictive model to forecast Divvy bike usage across Chicago, providing
actionable insights into fleet distribution and operational efficiency.
The primary stakeholder for this project is the Chicago Department of Transportation
(CDOT). Our predictive insights into bike usage patterns can guide CDOT in planning
and allocating resources for the bike-sharing program, enhancing service availability
and reliability. Additionally, this information supports strategic decisions regarding the
expansion of services and integration with other transportation modes, aiming to
optimize the cityâ€™s bike-sharing infrastructure and improve urban mobility.
In this project, we utilized a comprehensive dataset that includes millions of anonymized
bike trips, geographical boundaries of Chicago neighborhoods, and environmental
factors like weather conditions, combined with public holiday data. By applying machine
learning models to these datasets, we have developed predictive tools that can forecast
daily bike usage demand with a high degree of accuracy.
